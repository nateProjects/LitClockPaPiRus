# LitClock

This is a typical literary clock, written in Python and displayed with Tkinter. Run it on a Raspberry Pi (or something similiar) and you can mount up an e-ink display to make a nice looking wall clock that definitely won't make you look pretentious to your guests!

pip install python-dateutil
